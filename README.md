## Bell

Bell is an experimental computer programming language for Arduino microcontrollers.

The Bell language is inspired by Smalltalk, Forth, and APL. It is an experiment in pragmatic minimalism.

The goal of Bell is to provide an easy way for creative people interested in making music and art projects to integrate computers into their work without making the process all about the computers.
It is designed to be a programming language for non-programmers and to run on hardware built by non-engineers.

Steven Hazel has been my copilot on countless delves into the fundamental philosophical essence of computation for decades.
Many thanks to my friend Will Cook for numerous inspirational discussions, particularly on the fundamental nature of objects.
